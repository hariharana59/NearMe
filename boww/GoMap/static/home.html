            There isn't a specific place called "Royal Palace City" in Thanjavur that I'm aware of.
             However, if you're referring to the area around the Royal Palace and its vicinity in Thanjavur, it holds great historical and cultural significance. 
             The Royal Palace, also known as the Thanjavur Maratha Palace, is a sprawling complex that reflects the architectural styles of the Nayaks, Marathas, and the Vijayanagara Empire.
             The palace complex includes the Sadar Mahal Palace, which now houses the Royal Palace Museum showcasing a fascinating collection of artifacts and treasures from the region's history. 
             The Saraswathi Mahal Library, within the palace grounds, is one of Asia's oldest libraries, known for its vast collection of ancient manuscripts and books.
             Nearby, you'll find the iconic Brihadeeswarar Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a masterpiece of Chola architecture.
