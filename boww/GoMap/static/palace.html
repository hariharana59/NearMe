        The Maratha Palace in Thanjavur, also known as the Nayak Palace, is a historic complex that stands as a testament to the Maratha rule in Thanjavur. 
        Built around the 17th century by the rulers of the Bhonsle dynasty, who were descendants of the Maratha warrior king Shivaji, 
        the palace complex is a blend of Maratha, Nayak, and European architectural styles.
       The Maratha Palace complex is comprised of several buildings, courtyards, and structures, each with its own unique features and significance. 
       The Durbar Hall, or the audience hall, is one of the most impressive structures in the palace complex, with its grand arches, intricate carvings, and majestic pillars. 
       This hall was used for official ceremonies and meetings during the Maratha rule.
       Another notable feature of the Maratha Palace is the Saraswathi Mahal Library, which is one of the oldest libraries in Asia
