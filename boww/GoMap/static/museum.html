        The Royal Palace Museum in Thanjavur, also known as the Tanjore Palace, is a historic site that offers a glimpse into the rich history and culture of the region.
         The palace complex was originally built by the Nayakas of Thanjavur around the 16th century and later renovated and expanded by the Marathas and the British.
        The museum is housed in the Sadar Mahal Palace, a part of the larger palace complex, and showcases a fascinating collection of artifacts that highlight the artistic, cultural, and architectural heritage of Thanjavur. 
        The museum's collection includes a wide range of items such as sculptures, paintings, weapons, musical instruments, and royal artifacts.
