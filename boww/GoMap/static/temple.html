        Thanjavur Kovil, also known as the Brihadeeswarar Temple or Peruvudaiyar Kovil, is a masterpiece of Dravidian architecture located in the city of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, India.
         Built by the Chola emperor Raja Raja Chola I in the 11th century, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is considered one of the greatest architectural achievements of the Chola dynasty. 
        The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is renowned for its grandeur, architectural excellence, and exquisite sculptures.
        The most striking feature of the Thanjavur Kovil is its towering vimana, or temple tower, which rises to a height of about 66 meters (216 feet) and is capped by a massive monolithic cupola weighing around 80 tons.
        This cupola is believed to have been placed at the top of the vimana using a 6-kilometer long ramp, an engineering feat that showcases the advanced skills of the Chola architects and artisans.
